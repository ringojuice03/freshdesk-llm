    "\n",
    "## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "### CORE PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "- Must be based on the main concern of the customer\n",
    "- If multiple concerns exist, focus on the main one. ONLY ONE customer problem should be included in the CORE PROBLEM STATEMENT.\n",
    "- Do NOT include assumptions about possible impact to the customer\n",
    "- Focus only on problems explicitly stated by the customer\n",
    "- If no problem exists, output: \"No identifiable problem\"\n",
    "- Length: Exactly 2-3 sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "### RESOLUTION\n",
    "- Must be based on concrete actions taken by the agent to resolve the customer's main issue\n",
    "- Promises, reassurances, explanations, or status updates do NOT count as resolution\n",
    "- If no concrete resolution exists, output: \"Unresolved\"\n",
    "- Length: Exactly 2-3 sentences for resolved cases, single word \"Unresolved\" for unresolved cases\n",
    "\n",
    "## WHAT CONSTITUTES CONCRETE RESOLUTION\n",
    "**RESOLVED status requires concrete action taken by the agent:**\n",
    "- Refund processed and confirmed\n",
    "- Replacement item dispatched\n",
    "- Technical issue fixed (account unlocked, payment processed, etc.)\n",
    "- Correct information provided with verification\n",
    "- Problem directly addressed with measurable outcome\n",
    "- Compensation or credits applied to account\n",
    "\n",
    "## WHAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE RESOLUTION\n",
    "**The following are NOT resolutions and should be marked \"Unresolved\":**\n",
    "- Promises or reassurances (\"we will try\", \"team will attempt\", \"we will follow up\")\n",
    "- Explanations without solutions (explaining why problem occurred)\n",
    "- Information gathering only (asking for details without solving)\n",
    "- Escalations without final resolution\n",
    "- Apologies without corrective action\n",
    "- Status updates without problem resolution\n",
    "- Acknowledgments of concerns without action\n",
    "\n",
    "## OBJECTIVITY REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "**ELIMINATE ALL EMOTIONAL AND SUBJECTIVE LANGUAGE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prohibited Emotional Language\n",
    "- Customer emotions: \"frustrated\", \"angry\", \"upset\", \"disappointed\", \"happy\", \"satisfied\", \"annoyed\", \"worried\", \"concerned\", \"stressed\"\n",
    "- Agent emotions: \"apologetic\", \"sympathetic\", \"understanding\", \"helpful\", \"caring\"\n",
    "- Emotional reactions: \"complained\", \"expressed dissatisfaction\", \"was pleased\", \"felt relieved\"\n",
    "- Subjective descriptions: \"terrible experience\", \"great service\", \"poor quality\", \"excellent response\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Objective Language\n",
    "- Use factual, neutral verbs: \"reported\", \"stated\", \"indicated\", \"requested\", \"received\", \"experienced\"\n",
    "- Focus on actions and events, not feelings about them\n",
    "- Describe what happened, not how anyone felt about it\n",
    "- Use technical, operational language\n",
    "\n",
    "## NORMALIZATION RULES\n",
    "Replace all specific details with standardized terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customer References\n",
    "- Any customer name → \"customer\"\n",
    "- Any store name → \"customer's store\"\n",
    "- Any order number/ID → \"customer order\"\n",
    "- Any account details → \"customer account\"\n",
    "- Specific amounts → \"order amount\" or \"payment amount\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRITICAL: Product Normalization\n",
    "**ALWAYS replace ALL specific product names with \"items\"**\n",
    "- \"Nescafe 3-in-1 sachets\" → \"items\"\n",
    "- \"Tide powder 1kg\" → \"items\"\n",
    "- \"Lucky Me noodles\" → \"items\"\n",
    "- \"Coca-Cola 1.5L\" → \"items\"\n",
    "- \"Pantene shampoo\" → \"items\"\n",
    "- \"Kopiko coffee\" → \"items\"\n",
    "- \"Maggi seasoning\" → \"items\"\n",
    "- ANY brand name or specific product → \"items\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time References\n",
    "- Specific dates → \"scheduled delivery date\"\n",
    "- Specific times → \"delivery time\"\n",
    "- Time periods → \"delivery window\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Location References\n",
    "- Specific addresses → \"delivery location\"\n",
    "- Cities/regions → \"delivery area\"\n",
    "- Landmarks → \"delivery location\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### External Factors\n",
    "- Weather events (storms, typhoons, floods) → \"weather conditions\"\n",
    "- Traffic issues → \"traffic conditions\"\n",
    "- System problems → \"technical issues\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Terms\n",
    "- \"App crashed/froze/stopped/won't work\" → \"mobile application became unresponsive\"\n",
    "- \"Payment failed/declined/error/won't process\" → \"payment processing failed\"\n",
    "- \"Can't login/access/sign in\" → \"authentication failed\"\n",
    "- \"Won't load/loading/stuck loading\" → \"content failed to load\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS\n",
    "1. Read the conversation completely to identify the main customer concern\n",
    "2. Apply ALL normalization rules - especially product normalization to \"items\"\n",
    "3. Mark as \"RESOLVED\" ONLY if concrete action was taken to fix the problem\n",
    "4. If only promises, explanations, or reassurances were given, mark as \"Unresolved\"\n",
    "5. Remove all specific dates, times, locations, and external factors\n",
    "6. Focus on the functional problem, not emotional context\n",
    "7. Ensure language is generic and searchable for RAG retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "## OUTPUT FORMAT\n",
    "Always return output in exactly the following format with no additional commentary, explanations, or formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "CORE PROBLEM STATEMENT:\n",
